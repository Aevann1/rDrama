			Hiiiii it's carp! I think this error means that there's a timeout error. And I think that means something took too long to load so it decided not to work at all. If you keep seeing this on the same page <em>but not other pages</em>, then something is probably wrong with that specific function. It may not be called a function, but that sounds right to me. Anyway, ping me and I'll whine to someone smarter to fix it. Don't bother them. Thanks ily <3
