# Formatting rules: #
#####################
#
# on the slur side, they will match prefixes and suffixes and not middle of words, so for example
#   "retard" will match:
#       - "retard"
#       - "retarded"
#       - "superretard"
#       But not "superretarded"
#
# If all letters are lowercase then it will match lowercase, first letter up in first or all the words and all letters up
#    "dancing israelis" will match (with prefixes and suffixes omitted for brevity):
#  	    - "dancing israelis"
#  	    - "Dancing israelis"
#       - "Dancing Israelis"
#    	- "DANCING ISRAELIS"
#
# If some letters are Uppercase, the same, but with the additional option of the original casing, and respecting already existing uppercase
#    "NoNewNormal" will match (with prefixes and suffixes omitted for brevity):
#       - "NoNewNormal"
#       - "nonewnormal"
#       - "Nonewnormal"
#       - "NONEWNORMAL"
#
# If the slur has a space before and after then the match is limited to the exact word, no prefixes or suffixes
# (previous rules about capitalization still apply)
#   " neg " will match only:
#       - "neg"
#       - "Neg"
#       - "NEG"
#
# Now on the replacement side, The replacement will have the same capitalization as the slur if the replacement is lowercase
#   "kill yourself" -> "keep yourself safe"
#   "Kill yourself" -> "Keep yourself safe"
#   "Kill Yourself" -> "Keep Yourself Safe"
#   "KILL YOURSELF" -> "KEEP YOURSELF SAFE"
#
# If the replacement side has some capitalization, then that capitalization will always be maintained
#   for the pair: <"pajeet": "sexy Indian dude"> it will replace:
#       "pajeet" -> "sexy Indian dude"
#       "Pajeet" -> "Sexy Indian dude"
#       "PAJEET" -> "SEXY INDIAN DUDE"
#
# There is a super special case that if the replacer starts with "http" then it never changes capitalization
#
#
# TL;DR: Just read the above once, or don't, and try to guess!

VAXX_MSG = """Hi @{username}, it appears that you may be trying to spread dangerous misinformation regarding ineffective COVID-19 treatments based on pseudoscientific hearsay. Your post has been removed because it contained the word ivermectin. We ask that you understand that horse dewormer neither treats, nor prevents, COVID-19. For more information, please read up on what the FDA has to say on the matter:

https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19

COVID-19 is not a joke, it is a global pandemic and it has been hard on all of us. It will likely go down as one of the most defining periods of our generation. Many of us have lost loved ones to the virus. It has caused confusion, fear, frustration, and served to further divide us. Tens of millions around the world have died. There is nothing to be gained by spreading bad science based on very understandable fear.

The only proven method of prevention is the COVID-19 vaccine, paired with appropriate social distancing, handwashing, and masks. Vaccines are free in the United States - if you'd like to locate your nearest vaccine provider, please visit https://www.vaccines.gov/ and schedule an appointment today.

Thank you."""
